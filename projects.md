### Workstation Setup

For quite some time now I’ve maintained a list of applications and other config that I use when setting up a new development workstation. This includes things like links, notes and gotchas.

To make it a little easer to find and use, I’ve [created a GitHub repo](https://github.com/gianlorenzetto/setup) and started populating it with everything and anything I’ve found useful.

A lot of the tools and utilities I’ve picked up over the years I discovered through [Scott Hanselman’s Ultimate Tools List](http://hanselman.com/tools), which is a great place to visit every now and again to see what’s hot and what’s dropped off.

I plan to update this as I come across new tools, add and update config files and start a list of useful notes on configuring different tools.

Hope it’s useful to someone and please let me know if there’s a better tool out there! :)

### Azure PowerShell Scripts

A repo containing some very alpha `PowerShell` scripts for automating the process of creating a VM in Azure. You can [take a look here](https://github.com/GianLorenzetto/azure).
