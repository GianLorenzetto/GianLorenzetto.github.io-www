This is my blog and projects website. It's in a pretty alpha state right now, so please forgive any typo's, bad links and bad posts (hopeful only a few of the last one!)

### Me

**Gian Lorenzetto** BCM PhD  
Senior Developer at [Readify](http://www.readify/net)

### Profile

Still in the works ... 

### This Site

* Built on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com), which itself uses [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com).
* Design is based on the [Hyde](https://github.com/poole/hyde) theme.
* All of the content on this site was coded using the awesome [Sublime Text 3](http://sublimetext.com), with the following packages -
  * [MarkdownEditing](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/MarkdownEditing)
  Nifty markdown support including syntax highlighting and completion
  * [Jekyll](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/Jekyll)
  Adds some really nice jekyll support to Sublime,  automating most of the work in creating posts / drafts / pages etc._
* ... except for the occaisional trip to [StackEdit](https://stackedit.io/editor#), a nice WYSIWYG mardown editor, to resolve formatting issues.
* To make `terminal` time a littel more awesome I use [iTerm2](https://www.iterm2.com) with [Oh My Git](https://github.com/arialdomartini/oh-my-git) installed.

Have questions or suggestions? Feel free to [open an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/GianLorenzetto/GianLorenzetto.github.io/issues/new).

Thanks for reading!
