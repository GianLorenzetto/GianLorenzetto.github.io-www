### Me

**Gian Lorenzetto** BCM PhD  
Senior Consultant at [Readify](http://www.readify/net)

### Profile

Software developer, passionate advocate of agile software development and an agile mindset, cyclist and F1 fan.

I'm currently focused on helping clients achieve their business needs in the most efficient and productive way possible, using agile software frameworks and practices.

The last few years I have been working with .Net on web and mobile (Xamarin) applications. In a previous life I built desktop apps for image processing and 3D visualisations in C++.

A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away I did a Phd in Computational Geometry with applications in Computer Graphics. 

### This Site

* Built on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com), which itself uses [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com).
* Design is based on the [Hyde](https://github.com/poole/hyde) theme.
* Most of the content on this site is coded with [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com).
* A lot of the earlier content on this site was coded using the awesome [Sublime Text 3](http://sublimetext.com), with the following packages -
  * [MarkdownEditing](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/MarkdownEditing)
  Nifty markdown support including syntax highlighting and completion
  * [Jekyll](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/Jekyll)
  Adds some really nice jekyll support to Sublime,  automating most of the work in creating posts / drafts / pages etc._
* ... except for the occasional trip to [StackEdit](https://stackedit.io/editor#), a nice WYSIWYG markdown editor, to resolve formatting issues.
* To make `terminal` time a little more awesome I use [iTerm2](https://www.iterm2.com) with [Oh My Git](https://github.com/arialdomartini/oh-my-git) installed.

Have questions or suggestions? Feel free to [open an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/GianLorenzetto/GianLorenzetto.github.io/issues/new).

Thanks for reading!
