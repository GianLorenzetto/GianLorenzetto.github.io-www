This is my blog and projects website. It's in pretty alpha state right now, so please forgive any typo's, bad links and bad posts (hopeful only a few of the last one!)

### Me

**Gian Lorenzetto** BCM PhD  
Senior Developer at [Readify](http://www.readify/net)

### This Site

* Built on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com), which itself uses [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com).
* Design is based on the [Hyde](https://github.com/poole/hyde) theme.
* All of the content on this site was coded using the awesome [Sublime Text 3](http://sublimetext.com) ...
* ... except for the occaisional trip to [StackEdit](https://stackedit.io/editor#), a nice WYSIWYG mardown editor, to resolve formatting issues.

Have questions or suggestions? Feel free to [open an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/GianLorenzetto/GianLorenzetto.github.io/issues/new).
