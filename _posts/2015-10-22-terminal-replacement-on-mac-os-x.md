I've recently been playing around with different terminals and different sheels on my MBP.

For a good `Terminal` replacment, I really like [iTerm2](https://www.iterm2.com). It looks great and has a tonne of options to make it look and work just how you want.

I also stumbled across [Oh My Zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh), which I originally thought I was going to love. But for some reason I never really got into it. Since then I've discovered [Oh My Git](https://github.com/arialdomartini/oh-my-git), which is pretty cool - check out the screenshots if you don't believe me! It also makes use of the [antigen](https://github.com/zsh-users/antigen) package manager for `Zsh`, which I think is the way to go (rather than the `Oh My Zsh` path).

Here's a quick screen capture, showing my sites repo, with an untracked file, a modified file and an added file. I'm also two commits ahead of `origin master`.
