* Sailboat technique is nice metaphor
* Anchors / impediments is a nice analogy (if similar to other retro concepts)
* Wind / what propels the project is a nice change to the 'what makes you happy?' retro question. I really like the nuance on not just on the more passive what is good (or really, what is not bad), but what is actively propelling you forward, making you happy to come to work, morivating you to move the project forward.
