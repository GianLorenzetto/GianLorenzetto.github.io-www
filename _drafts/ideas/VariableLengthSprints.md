Ron Qartel, agile for humans

The Sprint Goal is one of the things in Scrum that has always had a smell about it. It is a critical part of the Scrum process, yet most teams I've seen either don't bother with a Sprint goal, or just regurgitate the high priority items (and yes, I've seen a Sprint Goal that consisted of an itemised list of the PBIs in the story.)

Even when the Sprint Goal is selected well, the other side-effect can be become so called secondary goals, whereby some other PBIs where dragged into the Sprint, because there was not enough work associated with the primary goal, or the next, related story is "too big". Heaven forbid they're using story points as absolute metric of what can / can't be included in a Sprint :)
