No Estimates

Steve McConnell

Estimation types - forecasting is what software dev employs, amount of future work (not judging he size of a crowd)

Estimation with low precision is not estimation with igh precision which is not estimation
Initial estimates are low precision, go/no-go decision making tool, not to be used later in the process as commitments

Software developers need to develop at least basic estimation skills

Story sizing is estimation

No estimation means different things to different people, but IMHO the words are not fuzzy.

Reducing waste in the estimation process is far more important. 

Don't break the PBIs down below necessary. This is team dependent, and a high functioning agile team, will be able to estimate quickly, based on sizing and will not need to spend long periods of time breaking tasks down into hours etc IN fact, I have never seen task breakdown into hours to be effective, for any reason. Use relative sizing and then use story points and/or story counting. IN fact if your story count tracks similarly to your velocity, then I'd suggest thats a good metric that your team is high performing.

Maturity in management to understand that estimates have a precision and a purpose. YOu cannot use estimates if the new context is different to that in which the original estimate is made.

So, estimation is necessary, at ideation, go/no-go, team formation, refinement and planning SPrint planning.

Bad news delivered early is better than bad news delivered late.

Management need to understand that an estimate has a precision and that an estimate is just that - it is nt something that can be used as a commitment or immovable goal.

Developers need to understand that the business needs to understand how long / how big / how much a project is going to cost. 

This is a joint conversation between the business and the development team, to ensure that all parties understand the current state of the project, how likely the team is to meet the original estimates and any impediments that have been uncovered that might impact on the estimate.

Assumptions must be made clear. These must be turned into facts to improve the estimate.

Estimates are not the problem. Management making bad decisions is. Teams artificially inflating estimates is. Lack of trust between the team and the business is the problem.

As usual, estimates like all tools, are there to start a conversation. In this case a conversation to understanding whether it makes sense to continue from the business side, including whether it is feasible from a technical side, within a rough budget. This includes the iron triangle, which side can move, how will the project be adjusted as it progresses should things go slower than currently expected.

This is not a negotiation, it's a conversation. The parties (the business and the dev team), both want the same thing. The product to succeed, the business to do well and most importantly, delighted customers. This is about problem solving, from all aspects of the project.

Don't agree to bad decisions. Don't agree to lower estimates if they aren't realistic.

Don't be afraid to say no, that's not possible. This gives the business the opportunity to decide whether it's really worth the effort. Coming down, then having the project overrun on time and cost will just break trust, cause more issues in the future.

Keep in mind what's in the best interest of the organisation. If it's a bad idea, tell the business. 

If the developers don't trust their own estimates, then the business can talk them down (out negotiate the team). This is a problem in skills, training and the business. You need to be able to defend your estimates. You can;t half-ass your estimate. But at the same time the business has a right to discover the real estimates,but shouldn't push too hard.

Something to look out for - the business looking for the "Nano Probablity Scehdule" (Tom DeMarco), the shortest schedule that has a non-zero possibility of coming true. This is not sustainable nor realistic.

Using velocity to forecast the number of iterations, but at the same level of precision as your estimates. It's more than a month, less than 6 months.

Forecasting by velocity is "Proxy based estimation" - how much variability in the things where counting (need a good number of these things to calibrate the estimation), the assumption is that the average in the future is the same as the average in the past.
