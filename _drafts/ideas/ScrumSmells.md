The parts of Scrum that the dev team can drive (Sprint Review, refinement, stand ups, retros) are very common. Less common are: co-located team (PO in particular) full time POs, a dedicated Scrum Master (not just Tim on the team, who knows a bit about agile), self-selecting teams. These are things that have a quantifiable cost to an organisation and thus is a clear sign of an organisation either being fully supportive and buying in to an agile transformation, or just paying lip service to the developers.
