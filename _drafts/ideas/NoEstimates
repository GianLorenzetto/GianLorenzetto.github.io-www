My take on no estimates

- You can still (and must) size stories in some fashion.
- Relative sizing is good (gut feel, is the story a good size for the Sprint? relative sizing, t-shirt sizing, whatever)
- Stop here ...
- There is no estimation, no associating any concept of time with a PBI
- Story counting is used for velocity (in my limited experience, this is just as good as story points)
- In particular, there is no breaking stories down into tasks and putting hours against them (I find this one particularly onerous, time consuming and wasteful)
