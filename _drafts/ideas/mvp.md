Quote: However, as opposed to the front wheel in the first scenario, the skateboard is actually a usable product that helps the customer get from A to B. Not great, but a tiny bit better than nothing. So we tell the customer “don’t worry, the project is not finished, this was just the first of many iterations. We’re still aiming to build a car, but in the meantime please try this and give us feedback“. Think big, but deliver in small functionally viable increments.

Quote: The key question is “What is the cheapest and fastest way we can start learning?” Can we deliver something even earlier than a skateboard? How about a bus ticket?

Quote: We learn some things along the way: The customer likes the feeling of fresh air on his face. The customer is on a campus, and transportation is mostly about getting around between buildings.

Commentary

And here is the payoff. We learnt something that is not in the spec, not in the backlog, not in the head of the PO. Rather, we learnt something that the customer probably didn't even know he wanted until it happened.

This is the magic of feedback. When we put the product into the hands of the customer (not the PO, not the stakeholders, but the actual customer) we close the feedback loop to a simple conversation between the development team and the customer. If you're not having this conversation then you aren't realising the full benefits of agile and iterative software development.
