* focus

* vision based on values and something to hang on to

* agile mindset

* Agile is not: faster, cheaper, better
* Agile is: about increasing value and customer delight
    * these are your focus

* The only thing that matters is delivery, more specifically, delivery of high value software that delights your customer
    * A corollary of this is that, so long as the team is delivering, then the team should be free to experiment with processes, practices and tools as they see fit

* Empathy is key
    * Developers having empathy for the customer and the business
    * Business having empathy for the customers and the Developers
    * Occasionally the customer having empathy for the business/developers when we get it wrong :)

* If your company / product vision does not fit with the goals and focus of agile (adding value and customer delight) you will experience friction with wider business.

* Gantt Chart is just a series of time-boxed milestones
    * does not solve the problems
    * does not understand the problems
    * states the problem (we need feature X)
* Problem breakdown and understanding happens as the team grooms the backlog and accepts the feature development into an iteration

* If you claim to be doing agile / scrum but the team is not self-organising, really self-organising, then you need to have a conversation about the other false assumptions in your process:
    * you are not agile
    * the team is being obstructed
    * the team is not free to work in the best way they see fit
    * management is doing command and control
    * above all, the team is not trusted to complete the work
* In all this, the team must take on the responsibility to make their best effort to complete the work, at a sustainable pace
