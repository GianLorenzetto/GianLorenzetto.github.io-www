Great device
Very niche
A lot of the ideas could be done as VR or AR, which are both cheaper (and easier?) to implement?
MR is key - contextual information, attached to some physical element is where hololens will be best suited
(training, maintenance, communication and shared spaces)
Physical considerations - pinching/holding arms out for long periods is not going to work
Head tracking would be killer on my neck??
